# Estate Executor's Mysterious Vault

Welcome to the prestigious law firm's vault unlocking exercise! As the executor of the estate, your task is to combine the secret codes of three families to access the vault's contents.

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will learn about namespaces and code organization. Namespaces help prevent naming collisions and enable code structure. You will use namespaces to combine secret codes from different families and open the mysterious vault.

## Namespaces

An important method for code organization is namespaces. They prevent naming conflicts and allow you to structure code effectively. Namespaces can be nested, and access is done using the scope-resolution operator `::`.

## Task 1: Namespace Setup

You'll define a namespace called `estate_executor` to encapsulate the code related to opening the vault.

```cpp
namespace estate_executor {
    // Your code for the tasks will be defined here.
}

Certainly! Here's a `README.md` file that explains the concepts and tasks you provided:

# Estate Executor's Mysterious Vault

Welcome to the prestigious law firm's vault unlocking exercise! As the executor of the estate, your task is to combine the secret codes of three families to access the vault's contents.

## Task 1: Namespace Setup

You'll define a namespace called `estate_executor` to encapsulate the code related to opening the vault.

```cpp
namespace estate_executor {
    // Your code for the tasks will be defined here.
}
```

## Task 2: Find the Secret Account Number

You hold the secret modifier key to reveal the account number. To assemble the correct account number, follow these steps:

1. Define the `assemble_account_number(int secret_modifier)` function within the `estate_executor` namespace.
2. Sum up the `bank_number_part` from each of the three families.
3. Return the assembled account number as an `int`.

```cpp
namespace estate_executor {
    int assemble_account_number(int secret_modifier) {
        // Your code to assemble the account number goes here.
    }
}
```

## Task 3: Enter the Secret Code

In this task, you'll combine fragments from the families to create the secret code:

1. Define the `assemble_code()` function within the `estate_executor` namespace.
2. Add all the blue and red fragments separately.
3. Multiply both sums to get the resulting code.

```cpp
namespace estate_executor {
    int assemble_code() {
        // Your code to assemble the secret code goes here.
    }
}
```
