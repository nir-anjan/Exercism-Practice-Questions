# Lucian's Lasagna

In this exercise, you'll be helping Lucian cook an exquisite lasagna from his favorite cookbook. You have four tasks related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Lucian's Lasagna exercise! You will be working with functions to calculate different aspects of cooking a lasagna, including oven time, remaining oven time, preparation time, and elapsed time.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Define the Expected Oven Time

Define the `ovenTime()` function that returns the expected oven time in minutes. According to the cookbook, the expected oven time is 40 minutes.

```cpp
int ovenTime() {
    //type your code here!
}

# Lucian's Lasagna

In this exercise, you'll be helping Lucian cook an exquisite lasagna from his favorite cookbook. You have four tasks related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Lucian's Lasagna exercise! You will be working with functions to calculate different aspects of cooking a lasagna, including oven time, remaining oven time, preparation time, and elapsed time.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Define the Expected Oven Time

Define the `ovenTime()` function that returns the expected oven time in minutes. According to the cookbook, the expected oven time is 40 minutes.

```cpp
int ovenTime() {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Task 2: Calculate the Remaining Oven Time

Define the `remainingOvenTime(int actualMinutesInOven)` function that calculates and returns the remaining time the lasagna should remain in the oven based on the expected oven time.

```cpp
int remainingOvenTime(int actualMinutesInOven) {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Task 3: Calculate the Preparation Time

Define the `preparationTime(int numberOfLayers)` function that calculates and returns the total preparation time in minutes based on the number of layers added to the lasagna. Each layer takes 2 minutes to prepare.

```cpp
int preparationTime(int numberOfLayers) {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Task 4: Calculate the Elapsed Time

Define the `elapsedTime(int numberOfLayers, int actualMinutesInOven)` function that calculates and returns the total elapsed time in minutes, considering the preparation time and the time the lasagna has spent in the oven.

```cpp
int elapsedTime(int numberOfLayers, int actualMinutesInOven) {
    // Your code here
}
```

## Getting Started

To start, navigate to the exercise directory and locate the file where you need to implement the functions for each task.

## Testing Your Solution

To test your solution, you'll run the provided test suite. In your terminal, navigate to the exercise directory and run the following command:

```sh
# Replace `language` with the appropriate command for your language (e.g., python, java, etc.)
language test
```

The test suite will provide feedback on whether your solution is correct.



## Conclusion

Completing the Lucian's Lasagna exercise will give you practice working with functions and calculations in C++. Once you've submitted your solution and received feedback, you'll be ready to tackle more advanced programming challenges!

Happy cooking!
